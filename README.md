# Activity Tiles

## Installation

Install like any other filter plugin - put into your /filter subfolder and enable in site filter settings. 

Note: if you want to use this plugin inside of blocks, you have to turn it ON for the whole site, since you cannot selectively turn on specific filters for blocks.

## Usage

Add ''{{activitytiles'' to your text, followed by filter parameters. All parameters are optional.
